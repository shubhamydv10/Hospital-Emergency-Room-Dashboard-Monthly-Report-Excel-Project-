# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard-Monthly-Report-Excel-Project-

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) of a Hospital Emergency Room (ER) on a monthly basis.
The dashboard provides a clear and comprehensive view of hospital operations â€” including patient flow, waiting times, satisfaction levels, and admission trends â€” helping management make data-driven decisions for better patient care and resource allocation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description 

The dataset contains monthly records of patient visits to the hospital emergency room. Each row represents one patientâ€™s visit and includes details about their demographics, service time, admission outcome, and satisfaction level.
